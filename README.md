# EtchASketch-javascript-project

Another [The Odin Project Cirriculum project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). Where I design webpage for pixel drawings. Used my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. Some details about project:

<ul>
<li>Colors are picked randomly</li>
<li>Besides single click, holding down mouse button and going around also works</li>
<li>Allowing users to clear the page without refreshing and letting them choose grid size</li>
<li>Size of the square that contains grid is dynamically gets resized so images doesn't lose their 1:1 ratio (since grid is initially inside of a square).</li>
</ul>

Project can be tested live on [GitHub Pages](https://emredogu.github.io/EtchASketch-javascript-project/). You can try it out yourself!
